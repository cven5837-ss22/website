    -   data
    -   doc
    -   figs

-   Import a data set of your choice into an R Markdown file, either from a dataset that was introduced to you during the course, that you have identified yourself online, or that you actually collected yourself as part of the course. The dataset should fullfil the following requirements:

    -   Req 1
    -   Req 2
    -   Req 3

-   Import the data, bring the data into a tidy format and prepare at least two (publication ready) plots to describe the data. The plots must fullfil the following requirements

    -   Must be of two different types (e.g. barplot and scatterplot)
    -   Must use illustratte at least three variables of the dataset and use the aesthetic mapping colour colour (e.g. x-axis, colour, fact_wrap OR x-axis, y-axis, colour)
    -   Must use a scaling function to change the colour scale
    -   Must contain information to be a stand-along self-explanatory figure (title, caption, legend title, etc.)
    -   Must have human readible axis labels

-   Export the figures as a JPG and store them in the "figs" directory with a name that follows best practices for naming conventions

-   Write a data dictionary for your dataset as a markdown file and store the file as README.md in your data folder
